# Reflective

Reflective is a simple, yet powerful, journaling app. Here's how it works:

1. :phone: "How's your day going?" - every day you'll receive a 60 second phone call from the app. This is your chance to talk about whatever's on your mind.

2. :green_book: Reflective will download a recording of your call and convert it into text. The next time you log into the web app, you'll be able to see (and listen to!) past journal entries.

3. :crystal_ball: Reflective's *insights* feature will run analysis on your entries to glean insights into sentiment, emotion, and keywords. It will then visualize this data to show how your mood changes over time, and how topics/keywords mentioned in your entries relate to your emotional state.
